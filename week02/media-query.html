      <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
      <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye
      must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind,
      yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the
      gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation
      whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>

      <h2>Moroni 7:46-47</h2>
      <p>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave
      unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail—
      
      47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day,
      it shall be well with him.</p>
